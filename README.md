# Cyclistic-Case-Study
Google Data Analytics - Capstone Project

## 📊 Project Overview

This case study investigates behavioral differences between casual and annual members of the Cyclistic bike-share program in Chicago. Using 17 months of ride data from January 2024 to May 2025 (over 5.11 million trips), the goal was to uncover actionable insights that support marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into long-term members.

The project follows the Google Data Analytics Capstone structure (Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act) and integrates data wrangling in R, visual storytelling in Tableau, and strategic recommendations grounded in behavioral segmentation.
